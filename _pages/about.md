I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in Optimix team in [LIX](https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/) (Laboratoire d'Informatique de l'Ecole Polytechnique) where I work with [Catuscia Palamidessi](https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~catuscia/) and [Sonia Vanier](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Z9WDDfcAAAAJ), in a partnership with [Crédit Agricole](https://www.credit-agricole.fr/) (French bank). I work on data privacy in machine learning, especially differential privacy. I am especially interested in the theoretical aspects of privacy, but also in its relations with other ethical properties like frugality, robustness, fairness.

Previously, I did my PhD between 2020 and 2023 in [CEA List](https://list.cea.fr/) under the direction of [Renaud Sirdey](http://sirdeyre.free.fr/) and the cosupervision of [Cédric Gouy-Pailler](https://gouypailler.github.io/). We proposed approaches that combine differential privacy and homomorphic encryption to protect the training data privacy in collaborative machine learning (federated learning, PATE) from any stakeholder (server, end-users, other data owners).

Before my PhD, I worked as a research engineer in [LIP6](https://www.lip6.fr/) in 2019, under the supervision of [Nicolas Maudet](https://nmaudet.gitlab.io/), [Patrice Perny](https://webia.lip6.fr/~perny/) and [Paolo Viappiani](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lxuuuHgAAAAJ), in the area of computational social choice. We proposed and studied a voting rule suited for the situations where some candidates may turn out to be unavailable after the vote.

Before this, I entered in research working in [CEA List](https://list.cea.fr/) for [C-BORD](https://www.cbord-h2020.eu/) project, under the supervision of [Jean-Philippe Poli](https://polijp.github.io/), between 2017 and 2018. I designed an explainable classification algorithm dealing with imprecise inputs thanks to fuzzy decision trees.
